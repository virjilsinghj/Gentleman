    <li>Choose social media marketing goals that align to business objectives</h6></li>

    <li><h4>Set S.M.A.R.T. goals:</h4></li>

    <li>The first step to creating a winning strategy is to establish your objectives and goals. Without goals,
    you have no way to measure success and <strong>return on investment (ROI)</strong>.
</li>
<li>Each of your goals should be:
<ul>
    <li>Specific</li>
    <li>Measurable</li>
    <li>Attainable</li>
    <li>Relevant</li>
    <li>Time-bound</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Track meaningful metrics:</h4></li>

    <li>Vanity metrics like number of followers and likes are easy to track, but it’s hard to prove their real
        value. Instead, focus on things like engagement, click-through, and conversion rates.</li>
    <li>You may want to track different goals for different networks, or even different uses for each network.
    </li>
    
    <li>For example, if you use LinkedIn to drive traffic to your website, you would measure click-throughs. If
        Instagram is for brand awareness, you might track the number of Instagram Story views. And if you
        advertise on Facebook, cost-per-click (CPC) is a common success metric.
    </li>
    <li>
        Social media goals should align with your overall marketing objectives. This makes it easier to show the
        value of your work and secure buy-in from your boss.

        <li>Knowing who your audience is and what they want to see on social media is key. That way you can create
            content that they will like, comment on, and share. It’s also critical if you want to turn social media
            followers into customers for your business.</li>
